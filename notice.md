##### the might was a no. exploiting still exists and is not any less powerful.
## NOTICE
EPIC BOEATS is meant to be used by exploits from it's design, and the use of an 'exploiter' UI library.
As of November, Synapse X has shut down and partnered with ROBLOX. This could **completely end exploiting** altogether.
EPIC BOEATS **(might)** be ported to ROBLOX Studio. Old versions will stay the same. Do it yourself if you want to archive this shit
